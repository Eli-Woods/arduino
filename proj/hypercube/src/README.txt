# Fix the circle drawing code, or how it is implemented in the circle_bounce animation
# Add more options for shell_wrap:
	*individual bands
	*a fade out that modulates the fade length
	*separate wrapping speeds for shells
# Write all animations to edit one shell at a time, and then use combinations and call merge_animations() after.
